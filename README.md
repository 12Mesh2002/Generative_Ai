# Fast Style Transfer

## Overview

This repository implements fast style transfer using a residual autoencoder network, instance normalization, and VGG19 for perceptual loss. The network takes a content image as input and produces a stylized image.

## Training Insights

- **Feedforward Network:**
  We use a residual autoencoder network, similar to the original implementation.

- **Loss Function:**
  The loss function includes both style and content loss, following the Gatys et al. paper.

- **Normalization Technique:**
  Instead of batch normalization, we use instance normalization for superior results.

- **Perceptual Loss:**
  VGG19 is utilized for calculating perceptual loss, ensuring that generated images capture the style essence effectively.

## Limitations

### 1. Computational Resources

Training and generating stylized images using deep neural networks can be computationally intensive. Users should ensure their hardware, especially GPU capabilities, meets the requirements for reasonable training times.

### 2. Training Time

Training a deep neural network for style transfer can take a significant amount of time, depending on the complexity of the network architecture, dataset size, and other factors. Users should be prepared for long training times and consider using pre-trained models if time is a constraint.

### 3. Dataset Limitations

The quality of stylized images heavily depends on the diversity and quality of the dataset used for training. If the dataset is not representative of various artistic styles, the model might struggle to generalize to different styles.

### 4. Style Transfer Artefacts

Fast style transfer methods might introduce artifacts in the stylized images, such as over-smoothing or distortions. Users should be aware that achieving a perfect stylization without any artifacts is a challenging task and may require additional fine-tuning.

### 5. Style-Content Trade-off

Striking a balance between preserving the content of the input image and effectively capturing the style can be challenging. Some styles may lead to more pronounced alterations in content, and users should be aware of this trade-off.

### 6. Hyperparameter Sensitivity

The performance of the model may be sensitive to hyperparameter choices. Users might need to experiment with learning rates, batch sizes, and other hyperparameters to achieve optimal results for their specific use case.

### 7. Memory Consumption

Training and running inference with deep neural networks can be memory-intensive. Users should be mindful of the available memory on their system, especially when dealing with high-resolution images or large datasets.

### 8. Generalization to New Styles

While the model may perform well on styles similar to those in the training set, generalizing to entirely new or highly abstract styles might be challenging. Users should manage expectations regarding the range of styles the model can effectively transfer.
